/* Small differences between solution and my implementation but result is satisfactory to keep.
All README requirements are met and two solutions look identical when not squished together
(besides the button height). Official solution adds two divs to html file, one for
right side of header, one for left. I only add for the left to group together the button
and profile picture. Real solution uses space-between in overall header to add a space
between right and left parts. I use margin-left on the right part to separate it from
the left as mentioned in one of the MDN documents and use a gap of 16 between the logo,
links, and right header. This results in a 16px space being present when the content
is squished all the way while it is not present in the solution. The reason my button
is not as small as the solution is because align-items defaults to stretch, so the
button is stretched to match the height of the profile image. The solution uses
align-items on the right header to center vertically the button using its unmodified height.
